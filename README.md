# Advent of Code 2019
Recording my solutions to AOC 2019 :) 

- ~~Day 1~~
  - Day 1 was pretty easy! Just simple looping and algebra, nbd.
- ~~Day 2~~
  - Reminded me a lot of a pre-fix calculator project I did back in college. It was one of my favorites! 
- ~~Day 3~~
  - I struggled a little with the wording of this day in part 2 -- at first, I thought we had to account for a wire self-crossing! Really, they just wanted us to account for if two wires cross in the same place multiple times (in that case, just take the first time it crosses).
- ~~Day 4~~
  - I feel like this shouldn't have taken me as long as it did? I made lots of stupid mistakes! But this one felt clearly worded and I knew what I was doing. The main thing was figuring out random test cases that covered all the different kinds of passcodes. 
- ~~Day 5~~
  - Again, lots of silly mistakes! But, this one was fun because I coded a python switch-case statement and learned about Python's strict evaluation (and how you can use lambdas to trick it into lazy evaluation!). Op codes 5 and 6 tripped me up for a sec — I wasn’t advancing the index at all for a bit! Then it clicked that I couldn’t just have the program do __nothing__ (duh), and so I started advancing the index if the comparison evaluated to false.
