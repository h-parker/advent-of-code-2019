# advent-of-code-2019
Recording my solutions to advent of code 2019 :) 

- ~~Day 1~~
  - Day 1 was pretty easy! Just simple looping and algebra, nbd.
- Day 2
  - Reminded me a lot of a pre-fix calculator project I did back in college. It was one of my favorites! 
- Day 3
  - I struggled a little with the wording of this day in part 2 -- at first, I thought we had to account for a wire self-crossing! Really, they just wanted us to account for if two wires cross in the same place multiple times (in that case, just take the first time it crosses).
